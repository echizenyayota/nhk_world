### A

"In social innovation, democracy happens literally every day. When your idea goes viral, the whole society changes" – an interview with Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Digital Minister.

### B

Former civic hacker and a top open-source software developer known for her efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Taiwan, Tang sat down with NHK World’s Doden Aiko to share her thoughts on why she believes fighting off the pandemic will be the defining characteristic of social innovation in the new world order.

Taiwan’s approach to stemming the major outbreak of coronavirus seems to be working as the world grapples with the pandemic. According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, the total number of confirmed cases stands at 480, with seven deaths, as of early August, and that’s without going into a full lockdown.

### D

The minister known as Taiwan’s IT Genius is far from the typical cabinet minister you may have in mind. Tang was featured in a recent edition of Vogue Taiwan, posing in a stylish designer outfit. Vogue used a robot host to quiz her on topics from tech to fashion. NHK World went the more conventional way by interviewing her on Skype. Video interviews and teleworking are not new to Tang, as she has been working on the technology for more than ten years.

### E

The pandemic is not new either, Tang adds. Taiwan has been through the SARS outbreak in 2003 that cost 84 lives. Painful lessons were learnred then on how to prevent future pandemics from wreaking havoc on island.

### F

It was chaotic during SARS, Tang recalls. And by that she means confusion and panic were caused by a lack of crucial information during the emergency. The panic was exacerbated by the lockdown of an entire hospital with more than 1,000 people caught inside after suspected cases of infection. PCR testing was not widely available, and what we know now as the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) did not exist then.

### G

Taiwan is now equipped with a communication strategy designed to ensure vital information reaches the public in time. Ministries and the Command Center work horizontally, so that municipalities and the central government speak with one voice. It all sounds like a classic public relations exercise, but Tang gave a twist to the operation so that key information reaches people fast.

### H

The key to avoiding a major outbreak has been branded, "Fast, Fair, and Fun."

"Fast" means that the government responded quickly. After the outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, Taiwan activated the CECC on January 2 before it had any local confirmed cases. A toll-free hotline stays active 24 hours a day, all year round, to handle disease reporting, consultations, and preventive measures.

### I

The e-Mask scheme Tang played a key role in establishing is an illustrative example of the “Fair” part of the strategy. Taiwan brought together a team of smart machinery and automation companies to expand the production of surgical masks. The government then devised a distribution system that required people to present their National Health Insurance cards when obtaining masks to prevent panic-buying and stabilize the supply, thereby ensuring fair distribution. It also monitored inventories at local drug stores using apps and enabled authorities to deploy a rationing scheme to allay people’s worries about shortages.

### J

But what if rumors take hold, or there actually is a shortage of essential supplies? What can be done to fight off fake news and conspiracy theories? That’s where Taiwan decided to factor in the “Fun” element. Instead of a government spokesperson explaining the preventive measures, the ministry deployed a “spokesdog” mascot that delivers the CECC recommendations.

### K

For example, the dog demonstrates how far people should be from each other for social distancing. Even Taiwan’s premier, Su Tseng-chang, got in on the fun and appeared in a cartoon shaking his backside and saying, “We only have one buttock each,” to fight off a rumor about a shortage of toilet paper.
