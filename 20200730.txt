### A

In times of trouble, a good book is like a good friend. Steady, reliable and full of wisdom. It can also show you what might happen and how you can prepare for the future.

As the coronavirus outbreak developed in Asia, I found myself turning to one book for a strange sort of solace - The Plague, known as La Peste in French, written in 1947 by French-Algerian philosopher Albert Camus.

The novel depicts citizens fighting against the titular plague, an invisible enemy sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran in the 1940s. It depicts the reactions of everyday people in the city under lockdown.
